Alpaca Hiring Task
Given a set of two dimensional points P (e.g. [(1.1, 2.5), (3.4,1.9)...]; the size of set can be 100s), write a function that calculates simple K-means. The expected returned value from the function is 1) a set of cluster id that each point belongs to, and 2) coordinates of centroids at the end of iteration.
